    <li class="fragment">Working principle of the slide format:
      <ul>
        <li>Use arrows (<code>&#8592;, &#8593;, &#8594;, and &#8595;</code>) to navigate the 2D slides.
          <ul>
            <li><code>&#8594;</code> switches to next main section</li>
            <li><code>&#8595;</code> digs deeper into topic with more details</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Press "<code>a</code>" to stop/start the voice-over.</li>
        <li>You may also just lean back, eat popcorn and let the slides auto-play. Should you miss something, you can easily stop, navigate back (press <code>&#8592;</code> or <code>&#8593;</code>) and re-listen to the slide.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">These slides are created based on the philosophy that:
      <ul>
        <li>The slides should be resonably standalone. I.e., they should work for both "live" traditional learning and "asynchronously" remote learning.</li>
        <li>The slides should be easily accessible and shouldn't rely on anything else than a simple web browser.</li>
        <li>The slides should be under version control and editable by approved teacher assistants (i.e. platform-independent and make use of open-source tools only).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">Slide technicalities:
      <ul>
