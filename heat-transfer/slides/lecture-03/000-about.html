  <h2>About these slides</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Press <code>a</code> to start the slide presentation with voice-over (make sure to have sound enabled).</em>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Working principle of the slide format:
      <ul>
        <li>Use arrows (<code>&#8592;, &#8593;, &#8594;, and &#8595;</code>) to navigate the 2D slides. Pressing <code>&#8594;</code> changes major sections and pressing <code>&#8595;</code> digs deeper into the topic with more details.</li>
        <li>Press "<code>a</code>" to stop/start the voice-over.</li>
        <li>You may also just lean back, eat popcorn and let the slides auto-play. Should you miss something, you can easily stop, navigate back (press <code>&#8592;</code> or <code>&#8593;</code>) and re-listen to the slide.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">These slides are created based on the philosophy that:
      <ul>
        <li>The slides should be resonably standalone. I.e., they should work for both "live" traditional learning and "asynchronously" remote learning.</li>
        <li>The slides should be easily accessible and shouldn't rely on anything else than a simple web browser.</li>
        <li>The slides should be under version control and editable by approved teacher assistants (i.e. platform-independent and make use of open-source tools only).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">Slide technicalities:
      <ul>
        <li>Slides are based on the <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js framework</a>.</li>
        <li>Slides are created using open-source tools.</li>
        <li>You may freely access and copy the <a href="https://github.com/jakobhaervig/courses">source code</a>.</li>
        <li>You may print out as a .pdf file by appending <code>/?print-pdf</code> to the URL adress.</li>
      </ul>
